       <p>The World Wide Web -- also known as the web, WWW or W3 -- refers to all the public websites or pages
          that users can access on their local computers and other devices through the internet. These pages and
          documents are interconnected by means of hyperlinks that users click on for information.</p>
       <p>HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the basic scripting language used by web browsers to render pages
          on the world wide web. HyperText allows a user to click a link and be redirected to a new page referenced 
          by that link.</p>
       <p>CSS is the acronym of “Cascading Style Sheets”. CSS is a computer language for laying out and structuring
          web pages (HTML or XML).</p>
